2. Create folders with your exam candidate numbers (E.g. 1234567) 
3. Insert your two Python notebook files with the names candidateCode-Oxford and candidateCode-Balearics (E.g. **1234567-Oxford.ipynb** and **1234567-Balearics.ipynb**)
4. The file paths should look like this: **energy-sources-assignment/1234567/1234567-Oxford.ipynb**

Please make sure that your names are **not** in any part of the code, just your candidate number and country group as appropriate.
