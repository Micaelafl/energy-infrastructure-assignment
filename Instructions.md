# Energy Sources Assignment Repo AY 2021/22

This repository is for MSc Energy Systems 2021/22 students to upload code for Prof. Malcolm McCulloch's Energy Sources Assignment.

Create folders with your exam candidate numbers (E.g. 1234567) and insert your two Python notebook files with the names candidateCode-Oxford and candidateCode-Balearics 

E.g. **1234567-Oxford.ipynb** and **1234567-Balearics.ipynb**

Please make sure that your names are **not** in any part of the code, just your candidate number and country group as appropriate.
